Module 2 Assignment

This project consists of functions used to generate folders from a list of desired names in current root folder with the options to collapse and lowercase folder names.  These functions are for educational purposes.  The first function, create_folder_for_range creates integer folder names in the range of the of two integer arguments passed to the function.  Functions 2 and 4 are more or less redundant since function 5, create_standardised_folders(), accomplishes the same task.  Function 3 has the ability to add a prefix to all folder names, where the prefix is passed to the function as a string.
